An application that allows patron and employee to track their kegs.


## üíæ Install

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com), and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

## Specifications


| Specs  |
| ------------- |
| As a patron, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I need to see its name, brand, price and flavor. |
| As a patron, I want to have kegs prices to be color-coded for easy readability. Perhaps based on their price (greater or less than $5 per pint, perhaps) or the particular style of beer or kombucha.|
| As a patron, I want to use the alcohol content property to display stronger beers differently than weaker beers.|
| As a patron and/or employee, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. A full keg has roughly 124 pints. |
| As an employee, I want to fill out a form when I tap a new keg to add it to the list. |
| As an employee, I want the option to edit a keg's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.|
| As an employee, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1.|
| As an employee, I want to be able to see kegs with less than 10 pints left so I can be ready to change them.|
